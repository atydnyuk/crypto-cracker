crypto-cracker
==============

Implemented brute force for rotation ciphers, caesar ciphers based on
frequency analysis and vigenere.

The vigenere solver is kindof crappy, but gives a lot of options if
you know some of the code, or the length of the code, or just want to
see the output from frequency analysis under different code lengths.

If you're looking for something better, check out pygenere. :)
